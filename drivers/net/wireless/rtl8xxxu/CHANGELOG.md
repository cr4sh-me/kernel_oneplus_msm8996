  ------------------------------------------------------------
  v0.3 - Minor changes and change of module name	                                
  ------------------------------------------------------------

  * Changed 'module' name, so it doesn't crash
    directly with 'rtl8xxxu(.ko)'

  * Added some minors to output, fallthroughs
  * Added more docs / beatify it



  -----------------------------------------------------------
  v0.2 - This is a mashup driver (experimental at this point)
  -----------------------------------------------------------

  * First upload. will add more code/patches from upstream and so as-we-go.
    This kernel is based from the rtl8xxxu upstream, slightly modified to work as
    a standalone driver and not a kernel extension. Also, severan chipsets is added.
    
    A good first release. Enjoy!
